# CapstoneTaylorSwiftLyrics
Exploratory Data Analysis of Taylor Swift's lyrics. This Capstone project demonstrates data cleansing and data visualizations.

The project was built using Jupyter Notebooks with Python, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. In order to view the code for this project you will need this software and libraries installed on your machine.

Included is a PDF document containing the results of the exploratory data analysis. This is for presentation purposes, without showing any code and only showing the visualizations and inferences based on the analysis.

This project was created entirely by myself, Calvin Liang. The data set is from Kaggle.com and can be found here:
